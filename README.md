This is the user-facing Home page.

This the user-facing page at `catalog/authors` that shows all the authors listed.

This is the `catalog/books/1` page that shows the details of the book "Looking For Alaska". The genre of the book, however, cannot be fetched from the backend. I will resolve soon.
